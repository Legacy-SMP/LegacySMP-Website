                    <p>
                        This is our first massive leap in the Legacy SMP Era, to push it into the max for players to enjoy the old style gameplay! Throughout it's lifespan, we'll continue to expand the
                        Legacy Theme throughout updates but for now we hope
                        you'll enjoy the SMP!
